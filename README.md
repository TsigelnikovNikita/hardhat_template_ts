# Basic Hardhat Project Template

This is a simple template of hardhat project used to TypeScript. Template contains a lot of useful packages for
smart-contract developing. You can find all of these in the ```hardhat.config.ts``` file.

You also can setting up settings of this config using .env file:
- ```COMPILE_VERSION```: version of solc compile what you want to use. By default is "0.8.4".
- ```OPTIMIZER```: enable (true) or disable (false) optimizer of the compliler. By default is
false.
- ```OPTIMIZER_RUNS```: amount of runs for your optimizer. By default it is 200.
- ```REPORT_GAS```: enable (true) or disable (false) report about spended gas by your contract.
This report will be generated when running test. By default is false.
- ```DEFAULT_NETWORK```: default network will be used when you run tasks, scripts and test. By
default is "hardhat".
- ```RINKEBY_NETWORK_URI```: URI of the Rinkeby RPC server. By default is empty. If you won't add
this variable, you won't be able to use this network.
- ```SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY```: private key of your address. By default is empty. If you won't add this
variable, you won't be able to use any additional network.
- ```ETHERSCAN_API_KEY```: your api key of [etherscan explorer](https://etherscan.io/). It used for
verification your smart-contract.

It's **strongly recommended** don't add your private info (such as api keys or private keys) into the
project files dirrectly and use .env file or environment variables!
